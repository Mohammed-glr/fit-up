# Repository Layer Updates Needed for FitUp

## üö® Critical Missing Features

The current repository layer is too basic for FitUp's intelligent fitness features. Here are the key issues:

### 1. **Missing Fitness Intelligence Data**
- No fitness assessment data storage
- No goal tracking and progress metrics
- No workout session tracking (start/end times, completion status)
- No recovery metrics or fatigue indicators
- No exercise progression tracking
- No one-rep-max estimates and strength progressions

### 2. **Missing Adaptive Plan Generation Support**
- No plan generation metadata storage
- No plan effectiveness tracking
- No missed workout handling
- No performance-based adaptation history
- No equipment preference changes over time

### 3. **Missing User Fitness Profile Data**
- No detailed fitness assessment results
- No movement pattern assessments
- No injury history or limitations
- No training history and experience
- No preferred training times/schedule

### 4. **Missing Advanced Analytics Support**
- No aggregated performance metrics
- No trend analysis capabilities
- No goal achievement predictions
- No plateau detection data
- No training volume calculations

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Repository Additions

### New Repository Interfaces Needed:

1. **FitnessProfileRepo** - User fitness assessments and capabilities
2. **WorkoutSessionRepo** - Real-time session tracking  
3. **PlanGenerationRepo** - Generated plan metadata and effectiveness
4. **RecoveryMetricsRepo** - Recovery and fatigue tracking
5. **PerformanceAnalyticsRepo** - Advanced performance calculations
6. **GoalTrackingRepo** - Goal setting and progress measurement
7. **AdaptationHistoryRepo** - Track plan changes and reasons

### Enhanced Existing Repositories:

1. **UserRepo** - Add fitness profile integration
2. **ProgressRepo** - Add session-level tracking and analytics
3. **ExerciseRepo** - Add progression rules and substitution logic
4. **WeeklySchemaRepo** - Add plan generation metadata

## üìã Implementation Priority

**Phase 1**: Core fitness intelligence repositories
**Phase 2**: Advanced analytics and adaptation tracking
**Phase 3**: Enhanced existing repositories

This analysis shows the current repository layer needs significant expansion to support FitUp's "personal trainer in your pocket" functionality.
